# Soap vs COVID-19

Soap vs COVID-19 is a project based on github's repository https://github.com/iribirii/soap_simulation by Mark Nolan and Inigo Iribarren. 

This repository is a web page meant to be an accesible way for people to learn how soap acts againts COVID-19 and why using it is so important.

## Usage

The website has three different parts (stages):
	- Stage 1: Simulation of how soap helps us to take viruses off a surface.
	- Stage 2: Simulation of how a virus is destroyed by soap molecules.
	- Stage 3: A post showing the science behind this process in a very simple way.
