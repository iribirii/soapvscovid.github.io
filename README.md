# Soap vs COVID-19

Soap vs COVID-19 is a web project that shows in an accesible and interactive way how soap acts agains COVID-19 and why it is so important.

The simulations shown in the project are based on github's repository https://github.com/iribirii/soap_simulation by Mark Nolan and Inigo Iribarren. 

## Usage

The website has three different parts (stages):

- Stage 1: Simulation of how soap helps us to take viruses off a surface.
- Stage 2: Simulation of how a virus is destroyed by soap molecules.
- Stage 3: A post showing the science behind this process in a very simple way.
